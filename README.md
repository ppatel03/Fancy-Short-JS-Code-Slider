Fancy-Short-JS-Code-Slider
==========================

Usually website developers want fancy sliders to be implemented in their websites. This develops the need of getting additional jquery plugins increasing the lines of code. Increase in lines of JS code increases the page speed which results in slow website loading. Also the page needs certain handling in IE to support those new added plugins. There is the workaround which I am gonna show by implementing fancy Fade-in Fade-out slider in simply 10 lines of code which can be easily editable as per the need.
